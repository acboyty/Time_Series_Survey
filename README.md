# Time_Series_Survey

We currently focus on selecting small(limited history) time series datasets, on which GBDTs outperform RNN and N-BEATS in one-step(currently) forecasting.

For example: lookback window size = 50, 1000 instances in total.

## performance

|      | RNN  | N-BEATS | XGBM | LGBM | CAT  |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|      |      |         |      |      |      |
|      |      |         |      |      |      |
|      |      |         |      |      |      |
